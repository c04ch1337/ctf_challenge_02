# CTF Challenge 2: The Shadow Web Portal

## Story
In a dystopian future, a shadowy organization controls the flow of information through a vulnerable web portal. You are a hacker working for a group of freedom fighters. Your mission is to infiltrate the portal, exploit its weaknesses, and retrieve 10 hidden flags. Each flag represents a piece of encrypted data that can expose the organization's secrets and bring them down.

## Objective
Find all 10 flags hidden in the web portal. Each flag is associated with a vulnerability from the OWASP Top 100 list. Use your skills to exploit these vulnerabilities and retrieve the flags.
